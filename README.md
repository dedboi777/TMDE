# TMDE (Tamer's Minimal Disk Emulator)
This is minimal custom disk emulator, made to implement my theoretical skills in low level programming.

# Requirements
1- Must use exactly 512-byte blocks in all operations.
2- Must use “dinit”, “dmount”, and “dunmount” to initialise, mount,and unmount the disk.
3- The maximum file size is limited to ~32MB.
4- Must follow a block design.
5- Must use the error codes provided in “os.h”.

# Execution
All the functions are executed in the "execution" directory.
And the user only has to write the function calls of the
features he/she would like to experiment(with the required 
parameters) in "command.c", and then call "make" followed 
by "./command.com" in the terminal.

# Thanks
Thank you for your time and care :)
